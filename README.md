# top-down-parser

Implementation of a top-down recursive descent parser in C++.

The parser successfully scans (with the -s flag), parses (with no flag), and evaluates (with the -e flag) arithmetic expressions involving addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, modulus, parentheses, and semicolons.
