# C++ Implementation of a Top-Down Parser.
#### By Michael Glushchenko for UCSB CS160 Spring 2022 (Translation of Programming Languages).

Idea: hand-code a parser to learn how parsing works firsr-hand.

The parser successfully scans (with the -s flag), parses (with no flag), and evaluates (with the -e flag) arithmetic expressions involving addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, modulus, parentheses, and semicolons. Precedence and associativity is maintained throughout.
